3️⃣ Suggestions for wired testing
Option A — Minimal bypass (best for debugging)

Connect DAC output directly to ADC input with a series resistor (~1 kΩ) for protection.

Do not add capacitor yet. Just check if receiver detects bits.

Option B — Proper RC filter

If you want a low-pass to smooth DAC:

Use R = 1–2 kΩ, C = 10–20 nF → cutoff ≈ 8–15 kHz.

This passes both 1500 Hz & 2500 Hz well.

Avoid 0.1 µF for this application — it’s too aggressive.
